## DESCRIPTION
* Lab Programs.
* Design, develop, and implement the specified algorithms for the following problems using Java language.

## OBJECTIVES
* Employ various design strategies for problem solving.
* Measure and compare the performance of different algorithms.


## Problem Statement

### Problem 1
* Create a Java class called Student with the following details as variables within it. 
USN,
Name,
Programme,
Phone,
 Write a Java program to create "n" Student objects and print the USN, Name, Programme and Phone of these objects with suitable headings.

* Write a Java program to implement the Stack using arrays. Write Push(), Pop(), and Display() methods to demonstrate its working.

### Problem 2
* Design a superclass called Staff with details as StaffId, Name, Phone, Salary. Extend this class by writing three subclasses namely Teaching (domain, publications), Technical (skills), and Contract (period). Write a Java program to read and display at least 3 staff objects of all three categories.
* Write a Java class called Customer to store their name and date_of_birth. The date_of_birth format should be dd/mm/yyyy. Write methods to read customer data as <name, dd/mm/yyyy> and display as <name, dd, mm, yyyy> using StringTokenizer class considering the delimiter character as “/”.

### Problem 3
* Write a Java program to read two integers a andb. Compute a/b and print, when b is not zero. Raise an exception when b is equal to zero.
* Write a Java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads. First
thread generates a random integer for every 1 second; second thread computes the square of the number andprints; third thread will print the value of cube of the number.

### Problem 4
* Sort a given set of n integer elements using Quick Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000 and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus non graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator. Demonstrate using Java how the divide-and-conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis: worst case, average case and best case.


### Problem 5
* Sort a given set of n integer elements using Merge Sort method and compute its time complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000, and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus non graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator. Demonstrate using Java how
the divide-and-conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis: worst case, average case and best case.

### Problem 7
* From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm. Write the program in Java.

### Problem 9
* Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given connected undirected graph using Prim's algorithm.

### Problem 10
* Write Java programs to
(a) Implement All-Pairs Shortest Paths problem using Floyd's algorithm.
