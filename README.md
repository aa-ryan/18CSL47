## DESCRIPTION
* Lab Programs.
* Design, develop, and implement the specified algorithms for the following problems using Java language.

## OBJECTIVES
* Employ various design strategies for problem solving.
* Measure and compare the performance of different algorithms.


## Problem Statement

### Problem 1
* Create a Java class called Student with the following details as variables within it. 
USN,
Name,
Programme,
Phone,
 Write a Java program to create "n" Student objects and print the USN, Name, Programme and Phone of these objects with suitable headings.

* Write a Java program to implement the Stack using arrays. Write Push(), Pop(), and Display() methods to demonstrate its working.

### Problem 2
* Design a superclass called Staff with details as StaffId, Name, Phone, Salary. Extend this class by writing three subclasses namely Teaching (domain, publications), Technical (skills), and Contract (period). Write a Java program to read and display at least 3 staff objects of all three categories.
* Write a Java class called Customer to store their name and date_of_birth. The date_of_birth format should be dd/mm/yyyy. Write methods to read customer data as <name, dd/mm/yyyy> and display as <name, dd, mm, yyyy> using StringTokenizer class considering the delimiter character as “/”.
